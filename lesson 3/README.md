## A note taking app `v2`

We may make it better, I think. The optimizations of code, local storage etc.

We will continue to work with the previous lesson code. You may copy it from [here](https://github.com/syrovezhko/learning-vue/tree/37dc6dbddb4f6237246fd60517ac7a2d71e88efa/lesson%202/src).

### Step 1: code minimize by Labels

You will notice that there are two most commonly used vue directives: `v-bind` and `v-on`.  
Usually developers used that's short labels: `:` Instead of `v-bind` and `@` Instead of `v-on`.  
Fore example: `v-bind:value="inputValue"` is equal to `:value="inputValue"`, `v-on:input="inputHandler"` is equal to `@input="inputHandler"`.

Now, you may minimize the code like this. Just do it!
